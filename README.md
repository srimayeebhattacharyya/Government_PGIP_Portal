Personalized Government Info Portal (PGIP)

In today's digital age, individuals often struggle to stay updated with relevant government schemes, exams, and tax-related information due to the vast amount of scattered data. This project aims to develop a Personalized Government Info Portal (PGIP) — a smart web application that centralizes and customizes government-related information for each user based on their personal and professional profiles.

The system allows users to create accounts by entering detailed personal data including age, gender, educational qualification, income status, employment type, domicile state, and more. Using this information, the portal will dynamically filter and display relevant government schemes, competitive exam notifications, and tax-related updates* specific to the user's profile.

The platform integrates AI-powered recommendation systems and rule-based filtering mechanisms to ensure accurate content delivery. Users will also receive personalized alerts, document checklists, and eligibility notifications to streamline their application processes.

This solution addresses the information overload problem and ensures efficient dissemination of government services, fostering greater public awareness, engagement, and accessibility — especially for underserved populations.
