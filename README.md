Personalized Government Information Portal (PGIP)

In today’s digital landscape, individuals often face challenges in keeping track of government schemes, competitive exams, and tax-related updates due to scattered and overwhelming information sources. The Personalized Government Information Portal (PGIP) aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized, smart web application that delivers tailored government information to each user based on their personal and professional profile.

Users can create accounts and provide details such as age, gender, education, employment type, income status, domicile state, and more. Leveraging this data, the system dynamically filters and presents relevant schemes, exam notifications, and tax updates aligned with the user’s eligibility and interests.

The platform integrates AI-powered recommendation engines and rule-based filtering mechanisms to ensure accurate and personalized content delivery. Users also benefit from:

Personalized alerts and notifications

Eligibility-based scheme recommendations

Document checklists for applications

Streamlined updates on government services

By addressing the issue of information overload, PGIP ensures greater accessibility, awareness, and engagement with government initiatives — particularly benefiting underserved populations.
